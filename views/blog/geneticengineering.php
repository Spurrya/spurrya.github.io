  “The science is quite clear: crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques  of

biotechnology (Genetic Engineering) is safe.”, quoted by the American Association for the

advancement of Science, shows that American scientists, unlike the European scientists,

believe genetically modified (GM) food is perfectly safe for human consumption. European

scientists believe genetically engineered food - which involves the modification of a trait in a

crop through scientific methods -  is a potential health hazard and should not be used by the

public (Kloor). Countries in the European Union are under constant pressure from the United

States government and large business groups to open their borders to import GM food after

signing the Transatlantic trade deal. This deal has been negotiated between the European

Union and the United States to promote active business between them. However, the

European Union is skeptical about the trading and consumption of GM crops and believe that

they pose a possible health hazard. Contrary to the European Union’s belief, GM crops have

proven to be safe for consumption (Harvey), have high nutritional value can avoid massive

starvation and is more targeted than conventional breeding. Although these GM crops are

common in the United States, they have been banned by the European Union. <br><br>

The European Union believes that people who consume GM food are more prone to

allergies or diseases that are resistant to antibiotics (Kloor).  However, these facts have been

proven false by several studies that show the crops produced by genetic modification are safe

for consumption. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recognised GM food safe

and the World Health Organisation (WHO) have not witnessed any ill-effects (Harvey).

According to the Food Allergy Research and Education, “nearly any food is capable of

causing an allergic reaction”. Most allergens are proteins and currently soy is the only

commercially available GM protein crop. The Food Allergy Service states that “...to date, no

food derived from GMOs has been found to cause new allergies.” (Lim).  Many scientists

believe that consumption of GM food has no ill effects as the genetically engineered material

is digested by the stomach. Research by a Salk Institute Professor suggested that the GM

material is not completely destroyed and reaches the bloodstream and the brain cells. He

believes that body’s natural defense mechanisms are not enough to stop GM material from

entering mature cells (Schubbert ,Doerfler). However, Amy E. Young and Alison Van

Eenennaam, both geneticists, proved this hypothesis false by analyzing data worth twenty-

nine years of livestock productivity and health before and after the introduction of GM crops.

The fodder for the livestock includes corn and soy which is 70 to 90 percent GM. However,

had there been any ill-effects, the farmers would have noticed and discontinued their usage.

To date, there have not been any reports of any health problems. When comparing the

nutritional profiles between the two diets, no differences have been revealed (Entine).   In

addition to being safe, crops such as Soy, corn, sugar, beets, and canola are few of the most

popular GM food items cultivated and have proven to have high yield, more nutritional value

and resistance to drought (Berlin). <br><br>

Moreover, it has been estimated that by 2050, the population of the Earth will reach

nine billion people (Kochhar).  At the rate at which the population is expanding, there is

bound to be a global food shortage soon. GM crops may prove to be a viable solution to help

combat this problem. According to Andrea Sonnino, chief of research at the U.N. Food

Agency, “The total food production at present is enough to feed the entire global population.

However, the problem is uneven distribution.” It must be understood that when analysing

food shortage, we must account for the distribution. Every country has different geographic

conditions, natural resources and economic circumstances. GM food needs to reach more

markets to ensure a steady food supply and provide greater nutritional benefits (Olster).

Sonnino believes that in order to meet the high demands of nine billion people in 2050, we

would have to increase our food production by 60 percent. He accepts that genetically

engineered crops provide an opportunity which we cannot ignore.  In addition, these crops

can be modified to be pesticide resistant and more resistant to environmental stresses.  For

example, a tolerance gene from the ‘grey mangrove’ has been implanted into a tobacco plant,

making it more resistant to extreme saline conditions (Terrell).  This is particularly useful

because of the growing environmental instability due to factors such as global warming. We

can accept that GM crops provide promising results to the farmer and society. <br><br>

Doug Gurian-Sherman, senior scientist for the food and environment program at the

Union of Concerned Scientists, argues that the conventional cross breeding  mechanisms

yield better outcomes at a lower cost. He further states that, “Overall, genetic engineering

does not get nearly the bang for the buck as conventional breeding”(Olster). However, the

current means of producing the crops using cross-breeding - where the breeder tries to

exchange genes between a plant to produce desirable offsprings - are not sufficient to meet

the demands of the growing population. In cross-breeding, the species must be closely related

and it can take a long time to reach the desired results. Often, the desired characteristics are

not available in closely related species or their trait is recessive. Genetic engineering has

proven to be more specific (where the scientists deals with only the desired genes) in

comparison to cross breeding where the breeder waits in anticipation. It has also been known

to save more time by passing the multiple cross tradition in cross breeding (James). <br><br>

In conclusion, the EU is progressively understanding how GM crops are safe and

economical. As of 2015, only one GM crop is being cultivated in Europe. This change points

to a positive future development for the GM agriculture industry. Adoption of GM crops into

public lives can be initiated by removing the barrier against trading of GM crops. Studies

have shown most of the concerns for not consuming these GM crops are invalid. If European

Union continues to remove barriers to growing and trading GM crops, they will benefit from

enhanced food quality, resistance against adverse effects due to environmental stress and

increase in the overall yield.  GM crops also propose a promising solution for food shortage

due to the increasing world population and can avoid massive starvation.  It has been proven

to be more efficient than conventional cross-breeding as it is more specific and rapid. In order

to sustain ever-growing level of human consumption, it is important that the European Union

embraces new agricultural methods such as cultivating GM food that can prove to be a great

solution to any potential agricultural issues.<br><br>
