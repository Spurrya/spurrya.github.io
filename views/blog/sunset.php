      <div class="section-title">Sunset of my high school years</div>

      The tickets were booked. My flight to Toronto was in less than five hours. The final

      chapters of my high school life were coming to a close. The path of the people I love

      diverged from mine. At the airport, my mother handed me a brown leather album with small

      wears around the spine. I recalled it was the same album my grandma handed to my mother

      when she left for Dubai back in 2003. “In your fourteen hour long flight, find few minutes to

      see this gift.” were the last words I heard before my flight departed. I feared what came

      ahead. I knew being strong was my only solution.<br><br>

      An hour into the flight, I reminisced about my last weekend with my friends at Dibba.

      I remember the details so vividly that I could fool myself into believing I was reliving these

      moments once again. The sounds of the waves roaring against the beach, the soft, smooth

      white sand beneath my feet and the sun rays gently kissing my skin. I was comforted by the

      rhythm of the waves, the caws of the seagull and the sway of the palm trees. Perfection of life

      was right in front of me. I was carried away by the soothing atmosphere that encircled me.

      After checking into the hotel, I had dropped my luggage into my room and gazed out through

      a French window facing the beach. Beside it, there was a table beautifully decorated with

      flowers and a tray of Baklava – an Arabian delicacy.  I decided to have breakfast and rest

      until noon after the long and tiring bus ride. <br><br>

      At noon, we boarded a ship for a cruise that stopped  near a small island where the

      water was shallow enough for us to swim. “Three, two, one” were the last words I heard

      before jumping into the water. Splash!, we were instantaneously surrounded by various

      species of fishes. I recall them tickling my toes as I snorkeled in the saline marine green

      water and absorbed the vibrant colors of the sea. I stayed in the sea until my fingers and toes

      wrinkled. Afterwards, I dried my hair and sat down with my friends eating various juicy,

      delicious tropical fruits and watched the sun slowly sink into the sea until a dark blue blanket

      stitched into the sky. As I looked above, I got to see layer upon layers of the sky with stars so

      bright you don’t need street lights to see your surroundings. I still remember the crimson

      setting sun, peacefully sinking into the sea It felt as if that sunset marked the end of the

      chapter of my high school years. That moment brought me to a realm of bliss.<br><br>

      “Miss. Miss, would you like some juice or water?”, said a young air hostess. I stirred

      out of my reverie. A shiver passed through my spine and my throat quenched for water. “Yes,

      water please”, I said trying to string words together into a meaningful sentence but my words

      were drowned by my emotions just how the sun had disappeared into the sea. I laid back,

      sipping water, calming myself and sinking back into my pleasant memories. <br><br>

      After the exhausting cruise, we planned to have local Arabian dinner. I wore a

      sunflower yellow dress and we decided to eat at a very small local Arabic restaurant. Large

      maroon pillows with embroidery were placed on the cool sand around a large dark brown

      table of low height. The pillows had reflective decor stitched onto them.  We could feel the

      heat of the tandoor and see the hot red coal where they baked the flat breads to perfection.

      The desert winds were there to make our surrounding nice and cool. I could hear

      conversations in a foreign language which I assumed to be Arabic and a faint Persian tune

      that was played in the background. There were about three lanterns that lit up the place and

      cast a golden glow on us. The aroma of the freshly baked bread had made me extremely

      hungry. Soon enough traditional, tempting and unique Arabian cuisine with various flavors,

      colorful decorations and a variety of spices and ingredients were presented before us. Grilled

      Kabobs, Chicken Shawarma, flatbread with Hummus, Falafels, and Cumin Chickpeas were

      few of the items present before me. After stuffing our belly, we decided to groove to the

      Arabian tunes. I wanted to capture this moment and revisit it when I was far away from

      home. <br><br>

      Eventually, all of us eventually got tired. We all laid down on the cool beach sand and

      observed the twinkling stars in silence. We could have stayed up all night describing our

      emotions but we all chose to remain silent. I felt a common understanding between us

      without any utterance. My eyelids slowly started to feel heavy and we slept on the beach

      under the thick dark blue blanket. The night passed away peacefully. We were awoken by the

      sounds of the seagulls to find the sun rising. I was completely lost in the moment seeing the

      sun beautifully light up the sky from complete darkness. A reddish hue filled the sky. I

      remember the cool dry wind made my mouth dry and I did not have any words to speak at

      that moment. I remember the sun rays growing more vivid with the passing time, I could see

      the sand sparkling at different angles and the waves rustle becoming more gentle. The sky

      became more radiant as the sun climbed higher and higher into the sky. Isn’t it funny how the

      sun represents our lives? How the sunset represented the end of a chapter and the sunrise a

      new beginning to another.

      Time seemed to slow down as every single memory ever created with my friends

      flooded my mind, each memory begging to be recollected and forever remembered, each so

      vivid that I believed I was living them once again. Memories like drinking steaming hot

      chocolate from a street vendor besides a small hill with our woollen mittens decorated with

      snowflakes in Istanbul, cycling around Princess island filled with exotic flowers, deflating

      tires before we drive our cars on sand hills,  casually meeting at Dubai Mall and attending all

      the festivals together are a few to mention.  <br><br>

      Memories were cluttering my mind, I was tangled in the memories of my past that I

      did not look at my present. As I looked to my right, I saw my worried reflection on the

      airplane window. I hurriedly opened the album my mother gave me. I was expecting to find

      many pictures of my family, my friends and my experiences which I expected to calm me. I

      found no photos a note in the inner pocket of the album. “Yesterday is history, tomorrow is

      mystery but today is a gift that is why it is called the ‘Present’”.  Thoughts about my past

      paused and I saw my present. It was a sudden break to my thoughts. I realized to every end,

      there is a new beginning. A new exciting opportunity is waiting for me ahead. I grew

      emotionally stronger seeing that note. I learned to have a positive approach for new

      beginnings.  I wonder how will the next chapters of my life look like?
